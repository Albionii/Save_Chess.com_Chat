# Save Chess.com Chat
 If you have a great message with a stranger in chess.com and the moment you leave the game, all of that dissapears. I want to use webscrape to save that. I am using javascript creating a chrome extension that will show a button only on the "https://www.chess.com/" site. With the click of the button the chat history is downloaded into a .txt file, but if the user accidentally removes the tab, refreshes it etc, it will still save it. The chat is saved temporarily into the browser's local storage until it is overriden, removed or deleted from the cache. 
 
 ## How to use?
 After downloading the source code, you need to go to the chrome extension managment, open developer mode and add the folder to load unpacked.
